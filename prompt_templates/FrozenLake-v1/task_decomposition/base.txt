## Task ##
You are a navigational agent in a 2D {SIZE}x{SIZE} grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries.
Your objective is to navigate to {GOAL}.
If given, always use the output format template.
Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = {MAX_TOKENS}.

## Environment ##
Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c).
Your starting position is at {ORIGIN}.
The grid has obstacles located at {OBSTACLES}.
Collision with boundaries happens when:
r < {LOWER_BOUND} OR c < {LOWER_BOUND} OR r > {UPPER_BOUND} OR c > {UPPER_BOUND}.
If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.

## Move commands ##
You can move in four directions:
"up" decreases r by one
"down" increases r by one
"left" decreases c by one
"right" increases c by one

## Objective ##
Given current position (r, c), navigate to {GOAL} using move commands.
Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.

## Decision Rationale ##
Think step by step as follows:
    1. Determine direction of the goal:
    From your current location (r,c) determine direction of the goal {GOAL}.

    2. Choose a safe command:
    Based on the direction determined in step 1, think about the needed increase/decrease of r/c and choose the next move command.
    Ensure that this move does not lead you into an obstacle or into a boundary.

    3. Execute the move:
    Give a single command to move in the chosen direction.
Continue this process until the goal is reached.
