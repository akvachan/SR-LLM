## Task ##
You are a navigational agent in a 2D <SIZE>x<SIZE> grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries.
Your objective is to navigate to <GOAL>.
Please always use the output format template.
Please always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 2000.

## Environment ##
Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c).
Your starting position is at <ORIGIN>.
The grid has obstacles located at <OBSTACLES>.
Collision with boundaries happens when:
r < <LOWER_BOUND> OR c < <LOWER_BOUND> OR r > <UPPER_BOUND> OR c > <UPPER_BOUND>.

## Move commands ##
You can move in four directions:
"up" decreases r by one
"down" increases r by one
"left" decreases c by one
"right" increases c by one

## Objective ##
Given current position (r, c), navigate to <GOAL> using move commands.
Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.

## Decision Rationale ##
Think step by step as follows:
    1. Determine direction of the goal:
    From your current location (r,c) determine direction of the goal <GOAL>.

    2. Choose a safe command:
    Based on the direction determined in step 1, think about the needed increase/decrease of r/c and choose the next move command.
    Ensure that this move does not lead you into an obstacle or into a boundary.

    3. Execute the move:
    Give a single command to move in the chosen direction.
Continue this process until the goal is reached.

## Output Format ##
MAX_TOKENS = 2000

Generate JSON containing decision rationale in the following format:
{
    "step_1": "",
    "step_2": "",
    "step_3": "up/down/left/right"
}
