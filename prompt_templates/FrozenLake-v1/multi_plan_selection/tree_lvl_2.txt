Tree of Thought (ToT) Level 2 prompt template

## Prompt ##
For each direction, consider in one (1) sentence:
1. What would the new coordinates be after making this move?
2. Is this coordinate in a list of obstacles?
3. Is it in the boundaries of the grid?
4. Does this move bring you closer to or farther from your goal?
Assign a probability of success of reaching the goal to each direction based on these factors (float between 0 and 1 is expected)

## Output Format ##
