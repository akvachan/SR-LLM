## Task ##
You are a navigational agent in a 2D <SIZE>x<SIZE> grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries.
Your objective is to navigate to <GOAL>.
Please always use the output format template.
Please always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 2000

## Environment ##
Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c).
Your starting position is at <ORIGIN>.
The grid has obstacles located at <OBSTACLES>.
Collision with boundaries happens when:
r < <LOWER_BOUND> OR c < <LOWER_BOUND> OR r > <UPPER_BOUND> OR c > <UPPER_BOUND>.

## Move commands ##
You can move in four directions:
"up" decreases r by one
"down" increases r by one
"left" decreases c by one
"right" increases c by one

## Objective ##
Given current position (r, c), navigate to <GOAL> using move commands.
Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.
