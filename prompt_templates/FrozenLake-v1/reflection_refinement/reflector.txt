3 LLMs:
1. Actor: Makes an action based on experience
-> Store this action as part of path
2. Evaluator: Evaluates actions of Actor to WRONG/CORRECT
3. Self-reflector: Explains the problem to Actor based on feedback of Evaluator

Good in case:
-> Actor makes an action that results in obstacle collision (Preemptive stopping)
-> Actor makes an action that is redundant (Advising)
