## Task ##
You are a navigational agent in a 2D {SIZE}x{SIZE} grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries.
Use the output format template.
Answer each prompt with one JSON
Your global objective is to navigate to {GOAL}.

## Environment ##
Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c).
Your starting position is at {ORIGIN}.
The grid has obstacles located at {OBSTACLES}.
Collision with boundaries happens when:
r < {LOWER_BOUND} OR c < {LOWER_BOUND} OR r > {UPPER_BOUND} OR c > {UPPER_BOUND}.
If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.

## Move commands ##
You can move in four directions:
"up" decreases r by one
"down" increases r by one
"left" decreases c by one
"right" increases c by one

## Objective ##
Given current position (r, c), output the best next possible move according to the Output Scheme.
Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.
