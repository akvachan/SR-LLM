2024-06-02 21:29:40,926 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 12x12 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (11, 11). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (4, 6). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 9), (1, 0), (1, 4), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 5), (3, 11), (5, 0), (5, 8), (5, 11), (6, 1), (6, 8), (7, 3), (7, 10), (8, 0), (8, 5), (8, 7), (8, 8), (9, 1), (9, 9), (10, 3), (10, 4), (10, 6), (10, 10), (11, 0), (11, 6), (11, 8)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 13 OR c > 13. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (11, 11) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: {     "explanation": "",     "step_3": "up/down/left/right" }
