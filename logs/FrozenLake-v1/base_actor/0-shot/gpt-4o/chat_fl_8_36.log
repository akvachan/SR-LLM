2024-05-14 11:46:38,880 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 8x8 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (7, 7). Please always use the output format template. Please always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 2000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (3, 5). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 5), (0, 7), (1, 1), (1, 7), (2, 1), (3, 1), (3, 3), (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (5, 3), (6, 0), (6, 5), (6, 6), (7, 4)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 9 OR c > 9. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (7, 7) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: {     "explanation": "",     "move": "up/down/left/right" }

Please criticize and evaluate decision of navigational agent as follows: 1. Tell whether this move is good or bad and shortly explain why. Consider following in your evaluation:     - Does this move result in a collision with obstacles or grid boundaries?     - Does this move put navigational agent in a dangerous or unsafe situation?     - Does this move have a potential to be beneficial in the long term? 2. Rate the decision of navigational agent from 0 to 5 (0 being worst and 5 being best).   ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: {     "explanation": "",     "rating": "int[0..5]" }

This move immediately fails to progress toward the target (7, 7) and puts the navigational agent in an unsafe situation. It does not have any potential to be beneficial in the long term as it requires immediate correction to avoid the obstacle.  Please choose a different move that is more suitable.
