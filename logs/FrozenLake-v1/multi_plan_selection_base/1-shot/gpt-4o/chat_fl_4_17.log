2024-05-21 13:46:28,742 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 4x4 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (3, 3). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (1, 1). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 2)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 5 OR c > 5. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (3, 3) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: null

For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence.   ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (6, 1) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1)]  User: You are now at (1, 7). For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Up to (5, 1) is a valid and good move, it does not result into collision with any obstacle. Down to (7, 1) is not an option since there is an obstacle there. Left to (6, 0) is also not an option since there is an obstacle there. Right to (6, 2) is still not an option, since there is an obstacle there. 
2024-05-21 13:46:36,133 : assistant : - **Up**: Moving "up" to (0, 1) will result in a collision with an obstacle. - **Down**: Moving "down" to (2, 1) is a valid move and brings you closer to the goal. - **Left**: Moving "left" to (1, 0) is a valid move but does not bring you closer to the goal. - **Right**: Moving "right" to (1, 2) will result in a collision with an obstacle.

It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 0| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 75%, since going left is slightly worse than going down. If I go right, my new position is (4, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 2| = 8.
