2024-05-21 14:00:24,302 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 8x8 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (7, 7). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (1, 2). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 6), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 5), (4, 0), (4, 2), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 1), (6, 3), (6, 6), (7, 0), (7, 4), (7, 5)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 9 OR c > 9. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (7, 7) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: null

For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Up to (5, 1) is a valid and good move, it does not result into collision with any obstacle. Down to (7, 1) is not an option since there is an obstacle there. Left to (6, 0) is also not an option since there is an obstacle there. Right to (6, 2) is still not an option, since there is an obstacle there.

This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |7 - 3| + |7 - 1| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, since I collide with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (5, 1). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries.

It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 0| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 75%, since going left is slightly worse than going down. If I go right, my new position is (4, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 2| = 8. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because of the collision.

This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |7 - 2| + |7 - 2| = 10.

Probability of reaching the goal is 85%, as the move is safe and does not significantly increase the distance.
