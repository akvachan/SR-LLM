2024-05-21 13:35:09,100 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 4x4 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (3, 3). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (1, 1). The grid has obstacles located at []. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 5 OR c > 5. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (3, 3) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: null

For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Up to (5, 1) is a valid and good move, it does not result into collision with any obstacle. Down to (7, 1) is not an option since there is an obstacle there. Left to (6, 0) is also not an option since there is an obstacle there. Right to (6, 2) is still not an option, since there is an obstacle there. 
2024-05-21 13:35:15,854 : assistant : Up to (0, 1) is invalid as it collides with the boundary. Down to (2, 1) is a valid move with no obstacles. Left to (1, 0) is invalid as it collides with the boundary. Right to (1, 2) is a valid move with no obstacles.

Assign a probability of success of reaching the goal to each direction based on these factors   ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (1, 3) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 4)] Current Position: (4, 1)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (3, 1). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |7 - 3| + |7 - 1| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, since I collide with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (5, 1). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 5| + |7 - 1| = 8. Probability of reaching the goal is 90%. If I go left, my new position is (4, 0). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 0| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 75%, since going left is slightly worse than going down. If I go right, my new position is (4, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 2| = 8.

This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |3 - 2| + |3 - 1| = 3.

For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence.   ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (6, 1) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1)]  User: You are now at (1, 7). For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Up to (5, 1) is a valid and good move, it does not result into collision with any obstacle. Down to (7, 1) is not an option since there is an obstacle there. Left to (6, 0) is also not an option since there is an obstacle there. Right to (6, 2) is still not an option, since there is an obstacle there. 
2024-05-21 13:37:00,296 : assistant : - Moving "up" to (2, 2) brings you closer to the goal and is a valid move. - Moving "down" to (4, 2) keeps you within grid boundaries, but moves you away from the goal. - Moving "left" to (3, 1) keeps you within grid boundaries, but moves you away from the goal. - Moving "right" to (3, 3) reaches the goal and successfully completes the objective.
2024-05-21 13:37:09,506 : user : ## Prompt ## For each direction, consider in one (1) sentence: 1. What will be the new position after making this move? 2. Is this position in the list of obstacles? 3. Is it in the boundaries of the grid? 4. What is the distance to the goal? Assign a probability of success of reaching the goal to each direction based on these factors   ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (1, 3) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 4)] Current Position: (4, 1)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (3, 1). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |7 - 3| + |7 - 1| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, since I collide with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (5, 1). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 5| + |7 - 1| = 8. Probability of reaching the goal is 90%. If I go left, my new position is (4, 0). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 0| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 75%, since going left is slightly worse than going down. If I go right, my new position is (4, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 2| = 8. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because of the collision.

2024-05-21 13:37:17,498 : user : ## Prompt ## For each direction, plan your path further in one (1) sentence. Are those scenarios generally safe or not?  ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (3, 3) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 5), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)] Current Position: (3, 3)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (2, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (4, 3). From there, moving down to (5, 3) is safe, then moving down again to (6, 3) is safe, and finally moving right to (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7) and (7, 7) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe. If I go left, my new position is (3, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go right, my new position is (3, 4). From there, moving down to (4, 4), then down to (5, 4), and finally down to (6, 4) is safe, and then moving right to (6, 5), (6, 6), (6,7) and (7, 7) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe.
