2024-05-22 19:37:56,786 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 4x4 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (3, 3). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (1, 3). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (3, 0)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 5 OR c > 5. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (3, 3) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: null

From there, moving left to (3, 3) is safe, and then moving left again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however if I go up to (2, 3) then I am safe. This path is generally safe, but I need to be careful not to collide with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (5, 4). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go left, my new position is (4, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles.

From there, moving down to (2, 2) is safe, then moving down again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however moving right to (2, 3) is a viable option. This path is generally safe, but due to the nearby obstacle one needs to be careful. If I go left, my new position is (0, 1). From there, moving right to (0, 2) brings me back to the current position. This path is generally safe, however it leads back to the starting point without progress. If I go right, my new position is (0, 3). From there, moving down to (1, 3) hits an obstacle, but moving right to (0, 4) is safe, then moving down to (1, 4) hits another obstacle, but moving right to (0, 5) is safe. This path can be safe, but one needs to pay attention to multiple nearby obstacles.
