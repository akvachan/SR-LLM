2024-05-22 19:57:35,833 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 12x12 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (11, 11). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (5, 3). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 4), (0, 9), (1, 11), (2, 10), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 4), (3, 9), (4, 4), (4, 9), (6, 3), (6, 9), (6, 11), (7, 3), (7, 4), (9, 1), (9, 2), (9, 3), (9, 6), (9, 7), (9, 10), (10, 11), (11, 2), (11, 5)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 13 OR c > 13. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (11, 11) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: null

From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid. If I go down, my new position is (1, 2). From there, moving down to (2, 2) is safe, then moving down again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however moving right to (2, 3) is a viable option. This path is generally safe, but due to the nearby obstacle one needs to be careful. If I go left, my new position is (0, 1). From there, moving right to (0, 2) brings me back to the current position. This path is generally safe, however it leads back to the starting point without progress. If I go right, my new position is (0, 3). From there, moving down to (1, 3) hits an obstacle, but moving right to (0, 4) is safe, then moving down to (1, 4) hits another obstacle, but moving right to (0, 5) is safe. This path can be safe, but one needs to pay attention to multiple nearby obstacles.

This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |11 - 10| + |11 - 10| = 2. Probability of reaching the goal is 90%, as it significantly reduces the distance to the goal without hitting an obstacle.  If I go down, my new position is (12, 10). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is outside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is undefined as it is outside the grid. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because it is outside the grid.  If I go left, my new position is (11, 9). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |11 - 11| + |11 - 9| = 2. Probability of reaching the goal is 90%, as it avoids obstacles and keeps the distance to the goal minimal.  If I go right, my new position is (11, 11). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |11 - 11| + |11 - 11| = 0. Probability of reaching the goal is 100%, as this move directly reaches the goal.
2024-05-22 20:09:52,446 : user : ## Prompt ## For each direction, plan your path further in one (1) sentence. Are those scenarios generally safe or not?  ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (3, 3) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 5), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)] Current Position: (3, 3)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (2, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (4, 3). From there, moving down to (5, 3) is safe, then moving down again to (6, 3) is safe, and finally moving right to (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7) and (7, 7) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe. If I go left, my new position is (3, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go right, my new position is (3, 4). From there, moving down to (4, 4), then down to (5, 4), and finally down to (6, 4) is safe, and then moving right to (6, 5), (6, 6), (6,7) and (7, 7) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe.  Map: 4x4 Origin:  (2, 1) Goal:  (3, 3) Obstacles:  [(1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0)] Current Position: (0, 3)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (-1, 3). From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid. If I go down, my new position is (1, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go left, my new position is (0, 2). From there, moving down to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2) and (3, 2) is safe, and finally moving right to (3, 3) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe. If I go right, my new position is (0, 4). From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid.          Map: 8x8 Origin:  (7, 7) Goal:  (3, 1) Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3)] Current Position: (4, 4)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (3, 4). From there, moving left to (3, 3) is safe, and then moving left again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however if I go up to (2, 3) then I am safe. This path is generally safe, but I need to be careful not to collide with an obstacle. If I go down, my new position is (5, 4). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go left, my new position is (4, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle. If I go right, my new position is (4, 5). From there, moving up to (3, 5) is safe, then moving left to (3, 4) is safe, and finally moving left to (3, 3) is safe. This path is generally safe.  Map: 12x12 Origin:  (0, 1) Goal:  (11, 11) Obstacles:  [(0, 11), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 10), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 10), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 10), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (8, 11), (9, 0), (9, 8), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 6), (11, 3), (11, 10)] Current Position: (0, 2)  Assistant: If I go up, my new position is (-1, 2). From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid. If I go down, my new position is (1, 2). From there, moving down to (2, 2) is safe, then moving down again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however moving right to (2, 3) is a viable option. This path is generally safe, but due to the nearby obstacle one needs to be careful. If I go left, my new position is (0, 1). From there, moving right to (0, 2) brings me back to the current position. This path is generally safe, however it leads back to the starting point without progress. If I go right, my new position is (0, 3). From there, moving down to (1, 3) hits an obstacle, but moving right to (0, 4) is safe, then moving down to (1, 4) hits another obstacle, but moving right to (0, 5) is safe. This path can be safe, but one needs to pay attention to multiple nearby obstacles.
