2024-05-22 21:01:22,023 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 8x8 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (7, 7). If given, always use the output format template. Always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 1000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (2, 5). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 5), (1, 4), (1, 6), (1, 7), (3, 1), (5, 2), (6, 5), (7, 5), (7, 6)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 9 OR c > 9. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (7, 7) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: null
2024-05-22 21:01:29,528 : user : ## Prompt ## You are now at (2, 5).. For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence.   ## Examples ## Map: 8x8 Origin:  (6, 1) Goal:  (7, 7) Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (1, 5), (2, 0), (2, 2), (3, 4), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 7), (6, 0), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 7), (7, 0), (7, 1)]  User: You are now at (1, 7). For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Up to (5, 1) is a valid and good move, it does not result into collision with any obstacle. Down to (7, 1) is not an option since there is an obstacle there. Left to (6, 0) is also not an option since there is an obstacle there. Right to (6, 2) is still not an option, since there is an obstacle there.   Map: 12x12 Origin:  (0, 8) Goal:  (11, 11) Obstacles:  [(0, 9), (1, 8), (1, 10), (2, 1), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 8), (3, 8), (3, 11), (5, 1), (5, 6), (5, 7), (6, 3), (6, 11), (7, 10), (8, 0), (9, 9), (10, 5), (10, 9), (10, 11), (11, 3), (11, 5), (11, 6), (11, 7)]  User: You are now at (0, 8). For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Going up is an invalid move, since this results into a collision with a grid boundary. Down to (1, 8) is not a viable option since this will result into collision with an obstacle. Left to (0, 7) is a valid and possible move, there is no immediate danger from executing it. Right to (0, 9) is a very bad move since there is an obstacle at that position.  Map: 8x8 Origin:  (7, 7) Goal:  (0, 7) Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4, 6), (4, 7), (5, 0), (5, 1), (5, 2), (5, 7), (7, 4)]  User: You are now at (7, 7). For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Going up to (6,7) is a valid and safe move, it brings me closer to the goal. Down is not a valid move, since I cannot go outside the boundaries of the grid. Left to (7, 6) is a possible safe move, there is no immediate danger from executing it. Moving right is not possible, since there is a grid boundary there.    Map: 8x8 Origin:  (0, 0) Goal:  (3, 3) Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 0), (3, 1)]  User: You are now at (2, 0). For each possible move: "up", "down", "left", and "right" brainstorm and analyze its outcome in one (1) sentence. Assistant: Going up to (1, 0) is a safe and very good move, since by executing it I am escaping the trap that I currently in. Down to (3, 0) is a bad move, that will result into collision with an obstacle at that position. Left is not an option since there is a grid boundary there. Moving right to (2, 1) is possible, but dangerous, there is an obstacle.
