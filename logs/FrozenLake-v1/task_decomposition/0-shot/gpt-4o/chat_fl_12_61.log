2024-05-14 10:42:40,598 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 12x12 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. Your objective is to navigate to (11, 11). Please always use the output format template. Please always generate response shorter than MAX_TOKENS = 2000.  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (4, 7). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 2), (0, 10), (0, 11), (1, 3), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 2), (2, 5), (2, 10), (3, 11), (4, 0), (4, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5), (5, 9), (5, 11), (6, 0), (6, 10), (6, 11), (7, 0), (7, 1), (7, 3), (8, 1), (8, 5), (8, 10), (9, 4), (9, 9), (10, 7), (10, 9), (11, 1), (11, 3), (11, 8), (11, 9)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 13 OR c > 13. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), navigate to (11, 11) using move commands. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Decision Rationale ## Think step by step as follows:     1. Determine direction of the goal:     From your current location (r,c) determine direction of the goal (11, 11).      2. Choose a safe command:     Based on the direction determined in step 1, think about the needed increase/decrease of r/c and choose the next move command.     Ensure that this move does not lead you into an obstacle or into a boundary.      3. Execute the move:     Give a single command to move in the chosen direction. Continue this process until the goal is reached.   ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: {     "step_1": "",     "step_2": "",     "step_3": "up/down/left/right" }
