2024-06-02 20:10:40,746 : system : ## Task ## You are a navigational agent in a 2D 4x4 grid world filled with specific obstacles and limited by boundaries. If given, always use the output format template. Just generate the JSON and nothing afterwards! Generate just one JSON and not more! Your global objective is to navigate to (3, 2).  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (3, 3). The grid has obstacles located at [(1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 0)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 5 OR c > 5. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), output the best next possible move. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: {     "explanation": "",     "move": "up/down/left/right" }
