Answer each prompt with one JSON Your global objective is to navigate to (1, 0).  ## Environment ## Each cell in the grid is defined through coordinates (r,c). Your starting position is at (11, 11). The grid has obstacles located at [(0, 9), (0, 10), (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 1), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 9), (2, 10), (3, 11), (4, 1), (5, 3), (5, 4), (5, 9), (5, 10), (6, 0), (6, 1), (6, 4), (7, 0), (7, 9), (8, 7), (8, 9), (9, 0), (9, 6), (9, 11), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 6), (10, 8), (11, 2)]. Collision with boundaries happens when: r < -1 OR c < -1 OR r > 13 OR c > 13. If you collide with obstacles the game ends immediately.  ## Move commands ## You can move in four directions: "up" decreases r by one "down" increases r by one "left" decreases c by one "right" increases c by one  ## Objective ## Given current position (r, c), output the best next possible move according to the Output Scheme. Avoid collisions with obstacles and boundaries of the grid.  ## Output Format ## Generate JSON response to the prompt in following format: {     "explanation": "",     "move": "up/down/left/right" }
