Moving 'down' will take me to (3, 3), which is the goal. Moving 'left' will take me to (2, 2), which is within the grid boundaries and not an obstacle. Moving 'right' will take me to (2, 4), which is within the grid boundaries and not an obstacle but is farther from the goal. The best move is 'down' as it reaches the goal directly.\", \"move\": \"down\"}"
