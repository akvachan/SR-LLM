User: You are now at (1, 7).
Assistant:
{
"step_1": "I am currently at (1, 7), the goal is at (7, 7), which means it is in the same column below.",
"step_2": "I cannot move down, since there is an obstacle at (2, 7) and I cannot move right, since it will result into collision with the grid boundary. Moving up to (0, 7) brings me further from the goal, so the only safe and logical move here is to go left to (1, 6). Afterwards I could move up to (0, 6) and then carefully move in the left direction passing the obstacles at (1, 4) and (1, 5).",
