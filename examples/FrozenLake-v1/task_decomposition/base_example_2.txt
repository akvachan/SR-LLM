"step_1": "I am currently at (3, 3), the goal is at (0, 2), which means it is one column to the left and 3 rows up from my current position.",
"step_2": "I cannot move up to (2, 3) since this will result into collision with an obstacle. I also cannot move down and right since this will result into collision with the boundaries. The only safe and logical move is left to (3, 2). Afterward, I will continue moving up towards the goal.",
