{
    "rank_1": {
        "move": "down",
        "explanation": "Moving down to (6, 7) is safe and provides a path towards the goal with minimal immediate obstacles."
    },
    "rank_2": {
        "move": "up",
        "explanation": "Moving up to (4, 7) avoids immediate obstacles and, although it increases the distance, it keeps options open for safer moves."
    },
    "rank_3": {
        "move": "right",
        "explanation": "Moving right to (5, 8) immediately encounters an obstacle, making it less promising but still better than moving left."
    },
    "rank_4": {
        "move": "left",
        "explanation": "Moving left to (5, 6) immediately hits an obstacle, making it the least promising move."
    }
