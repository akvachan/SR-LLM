    "rank_1": {
        "move": "right",
        "explanation": "Moving right to (6, 5) avoids immediate obstacles and moves closer to the goal with a clear path."
    },
    "rank_2": {
        "move": "down",
        "explanation": "Moving down to (7, 4) is safe and gets closer to the goal, though not as directly as moving right."
    },
    "rank_3": {
        "move": "up",
        "explanation": "Moving up to (5, 4) avoids immediate obstacles but increases the distance from the goal."
    },
    "rank_4": {
        "move": "left",
        "explanation": "Moving left to (6, 3) immediately hits an obstacle, making it the least promising move."
    }
