Map: 8x8
Origin:  (2, 3)

Obstacles:  [(0, 6), (1, 1), (1, 5), (2, 5), (3, 1), (4, 0), (4, 2), (4, 4), (4, 6), (5, 5), (6, 4), (7, 1), (7, 6)]

Assistant:
{
    "rank_1": {
        "move": "right",
        "explanation": "Moving right to (2, 4) avoids immediate obstacles and allows for further progress toward the goal."
    },
    "rank_2": {
        "move": "down",
        "explanation": "Moving down to (3, 3) avoids immediate obstacles and provides a potential path forward, though not as direct as moving right."
    },
    "rank_3": {
        "move": "up",
        "explanation": "Moving up to (1, 3) is safe and maintains a clear path, though it does not move directly toward the goal."
    },
    "rank_4": {
        "move": "left",
        "explanation": "Moving left to (2, 2) moves away from the goal and leads to a more constrained path due to nearby obstacles."
    }
}
