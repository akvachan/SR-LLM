Map: 4x4
Origin:  (0, 1)
Goal:  (3, 3)
Obstacles:  [(1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 3)]
Current Position: (0, 1)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (-1, 1). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is outside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is undefined as it is outside the grid. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because it is outside the grid.
If I go down, my new position is (1, 1). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |3 - 1| + |3 - 1| = 4. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because of the collision with an obstacle.
If I go left, my new position is (0, 0). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |3 - 0| + |3 - 0| = 6. Probability of reaching the goal is 50%, as it avoids obstacles but increases the distance to the goal.
If I go right, my new position is (0, 2). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4. Probability of reaching the goal is 80%, as it avoids obstacles and optimally reduces the distance to the goal.
