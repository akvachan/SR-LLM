    "rank_1": {
        "move": "down",
        "explanation": "Moving down to (3, 10) avoids immediate obstacles and progresses towards the goal, providing a clear path further to the right or down."
    },
    "rank_2": {
        "move": "right",
        "explanation": "Moving right to (2, 11) is safe, but does not provide a clear path from obstacles further down the road.
    },
    "rank_3": {
        "move": "up",
        "explanation": "Moving up to (1, 10) is safe initially but needlessly further one away from the goal, making further progress difficult."
    },
    "rank_4": {
        "move": "left",
        "explanation": "Moving left to (2, 9) immediately encounters an obstacle.
