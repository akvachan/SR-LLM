Map: 8x8
Origin:  (1, 3)
Goal:  (7, 7)
Obstacles:  [(1, 4), (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (4, 2), (5, 4), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 5), (7, 4)]
Current Position: (4, 1)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (3, 1). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |7 - 3| + |7 - 1| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, since I collide with an obstacle.
If I go down, my new position is (5, 1). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 5| + |7 - 1| = 8. Probability of reaching the goal is 90%.
If I go left, my new position is (4, 0). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 0| = 10. Probability of reaching the goal is 75%, since going left is slightly worse than going down.
If I go right, my new position is (4, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. It is inside the grid boundaries. The distance to the goal is |7 - 4| + |7 - 2| = 8. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because of the collision.
