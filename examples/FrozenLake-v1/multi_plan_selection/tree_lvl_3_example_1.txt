Map: 8x8
Origin:  (3, 3)
Goal:  (7, 7)
Obstacles:  [(1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 6), (2, 1), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 6), (4, 0), (5, 5), (6, 0), (7, 2), (7, 3), (7, 4), (7, 5)]
Current Position: (3, 3)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (2, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle.
If I go down, my new position is (4, 3). From there, moving down to (5, 3) is safe, then moving down again to (6, 3) is safe, and finally moving right to (6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7) and (7, 7) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe.
If I go left, my new position is (3, 2). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle.
If I go right, my new position is (3, 4). From there, moving down to (4, 4), then down to (5, 4), and finally down to (6, 4) is safe, and then moving right to (6, 5), (6, 6), (6,7) and (7, 7) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe.
