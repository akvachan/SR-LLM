Map: 12x12
Origin:  (11, 11)
Goal:  (5, 11)
Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 8), (2, 10), (2, 11), (3, 1), (3, 8), (3, 10), (4, 0), (4, 1), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 8), (5, 0), (5, 4), (5, 6), (6, 2), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 3), (9, 5), (10, 0), (10, 1), (10, 8), (10, 10), (11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 8), (11, 9)]
Current Position: (11, 11)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (10, 11). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |5 - 10| + |11 - 11| = 5. Probability of reaching the goal is 85%, as it significantly reduces the distance to the goal without hitting an obstacle.
If I go down, my new position is (12, 11). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is outside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is undefined as it is outside the grid. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because it is outside the grid.
If I go left, my new position is (11, 10). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is inside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is |5 - 11| + |11 - 10| = 7. Probability of reaching the goal is 60%, as it avoids obstacles but doesn't reduce the distance as effectively as going up.
If I go right, my new position is (11, 12). This position is not in the list of obstacles. It is outside the boundaries of the grid. The distance to the goal is undefined as it is outside the grid. Probability of reaching the goal is 0%, because it is outside the grid.
