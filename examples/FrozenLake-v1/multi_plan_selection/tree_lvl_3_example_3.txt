Map: 8x8
Origin:  (7, 7)
Goal:  (3, 1)
Obstacles:  [(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (0, 6), (0, 7), (3, 2), (4, 2), (4, 3), (4, 6), (5, 4), (6, 5), (7, 1), (7, 3)]
Current Position: (4, 4)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (3, 4). From there, moving left to (3, 3) is safe, and then moving left again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however if I go up to (2, 3) then I am safe. This path is generally safe, but I need to be careful not to collide with an obstacle.
If I go down, my new position is (5, 4). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle.
If I go left, my new position is (4, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle.
If I go right, my new position is (4, 5). From there, moving up to (3, 5) is safe, then moving left to (3, 4) is safe, and finally moving left to (3, 3) is safe. This path is generally safe.
