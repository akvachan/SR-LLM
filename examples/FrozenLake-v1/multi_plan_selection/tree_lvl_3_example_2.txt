Map: 4x4
Origin:  (2, 1)
Goal:  (3, 3)
Obstacles:  [(1, 3), (2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0)]
Current Position: (0, 3)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (-1, 3). From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid.
If I go down, my new position is (1, 3). This position is in the list of obstacles. This path is generally unsafe due to the immediate collision with an obstacle.
If I go left, my new position is (0, 2). From there, moving down to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2) and (3, 2) is safe, and finally moving right to (3, 3) reaches the goal. This path is generally safe.
If I go right, my new position is (0, 4). From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid.
