Map: 12x12
Origin:  (0, 1)
Goal:  (11, 11)
Obstacles:  [(0, 11), (1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 8), (1, 10), (2, 5), (2, 6), (3, 2), (3, 9), (4, 2), (4, 10), (5, 0), (5, 2), (6, 2), (6, 5), (6, 10), (7, 1), (7, 5), (7, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9), (8, 11), (9, 0), (9, 8), (10, 4), (10, 5), (10, 6), (11, 3), (11, 10)]
Current Position: (0, 2)

Assistant:
If I go up, my new position is (-1, 2). From there, the position is outside the grid boundaries. This path is generally unsafe as it leads outside the grid.
If I go down, my new position is (1, 2). From there, moving down to (2, 2) is safe, then moving down again to (3, 2) hits an obstacle, however moving right to (2, 3) is a viable option. This path is generally safe, but due to the nearby obstacle one needs to be careful.
If I go left, my new position is (0, 1). From there, moving right to (0, 2) brings me back to the current position. This path is generally safe, however it leads back to the starting point without progress.
If I go right, my new position is (0, 3). From there, moving down to (1, 3) hits an obstacle, but moving right to (0, 4) is safe, then moving down to (1, 4) hits another obstacle, but moving right to (0, 5) is safe. This path can be safe, but one needs to pay attention to multiple nearby obstacles.
